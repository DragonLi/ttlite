# Type checking of equality

Let's just follow type-checker step-by step by veryifing leibniz principle.

It is easier to grasp first a specialized leibniz principle for a particular types (in some type environment).

So, let's assume: A is some type, B is some type, f is some function from A to B:

    assume (A :: *);
    assume (B :: *);
    assume (f :: A -> B);
    assume (z :: A);

Now, there is a specialized principle. We explicitly type sub-expressions:

Schematically:

    let prop  = (\ x y eq_x_y -> Eq B (f x) (f y)) :: forall (x :: A) (y :: A) (eq :: Eq A x y) . *;
    let propR = (\ x -> Refl B (f x)) :: forall (x :: A) . Eq B (f x) (f x);
    let leibnizABF = eqElim A prop propR;

How is this definition type-checked??

1. Type checker checks that `A` is a type. (It is a type indeed)
2. Type checker checks that `prop` = `(\ x y eq_x_y -> Eq b (f x) (f y))`
   has type `forall (x :: A) (y :: A) (eq :: Eq A x y) . *`. It holds.
   Indeed, `prop x y eq` produces a type (proposition).
   Since `Eq B (f x) (f y)` is a type.
3. Type checker checks that propR has type `forall (x :: A) . prop x x (Refl A x)`, that is,
   `propR z :: prop z z (Repl A z);`.
   `propR z => Refl B (f z) :: Eq B (f z) (f z)`.
   `prop z z (Refl A z) => Eq B (f z) (f z) :: *;`


    :t  leibnizABF => forall (a :: A) (b :: A) . Eq A a b -> Eq B (f a) (f b);
